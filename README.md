# Get Go-ing with GitHub Actions
Welcome to "Get Go-ing with GitHub Actions" ([aka.ms/go-actions](https://aka.ms/go-actions)) at GopherCon 2020 (November 9th-13th) by Aaron Wislang ([@as\_w](https://twitter.com/as_w)) and David Justice ([@davidjustice](https://twitter.com/davidjustice)).

We will have two in-person sessions on:

- Tuesday, November from 10th 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM EST (3 Hours). See: <https://www.gophercon.com/agenda/session/421901>

We will continue to run our lab asynchronously on the GopherCon Discord channel throughout GopherCon via the \#microsoft (sponsors) and #github-actions (speakers) text and voice (workshop instructors) channels. You can also reach out to Aaron (Aaron W#0101) and/or David (devigned#6504), any time.

You can also join us for our Microsoft AMA @ 12:30 PM-2:00 PM EST daily from Wednesday 11 to Friday 13th (see: https://www.gophercon.com/agenda ), followed by other sessions each day.

## Micro-labs
Micro-labs are self-contained learning streams which can be done in any order. The content discussed within
each of the micro-labs is not intended to build upon previous micro-labs.

### [Tell your Story with Hugo, GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions Workflows [the-gophers/go-actions]](HUGO-GITHUB-PAGES-ACTIONS.md)
In this micro-lab we will help you get started telling your story to the world by setting up a Hugo site using
GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

### [Go for Serverless and Containers in the Cloud [the-gophers/go-actions]](GO-SERVERLESS-CONTAINERS-CLOUD.md)
It's time to use GitHub Actions to take your Go to the Cloud with Serverless Functions, Containers and more.

### [Building, Testing and Releasing for Multiple Platforms [the-gophers/matrix-builds]](https://github.com/the-gophers/matrix-builds)
Explore the use of matrix builds and Go's ability to easily target multiple arch / platforms. In this example you will learn about resources for verifying your software across multiple platforms and architectures concurrently, how to properly inject version information into Go binaries via a release workflow, and how to create an automated release with artifacts spanning multiple platforms and architectures.

### [GitHub Actions as a Function!? [the-gophers/tweet-dispatcher]](https://github.com/the-gophers/tweet-dispatcher)
Did you know you can manually trigger GitHub Action workflows? You can and some folks use this in some really
creative ways. Together, we'll walk through setting one up and doing something kind of silly with it. You 
will be encouraged to put your own spin on `workflow_dispatch` actions.

### [Building Your Own GitHub Action [the-gophers/go-action]](https://github.com/the-gophers/go-action)
Join us as we build our first GitHub Action using Go. Learn the basics of creating a GitHub Action, and 
how you can leverage your existing Go skills to build your own build automation.

### [Developing Kubernetes Applications [the-gophers/kind-knative]](https://github.com/the-gophers/kind-knative)
Let's build a containerized application and publish it to K8s. In this micro-lab, we'll use GitHub Actions
to build, test and publish our containerized application to K8s.

## Requirements
- A GitHub Account, of any kind, which has not exceeded its monthly GitHub Actions quota.
- An Azure Subscription (e.g. [Free](https://aka.ms/azure-free-account) or [Student](https://aka.ms/azure-student-account), or other), for the Actions that deploy Go Functions, Containers, or Storage, to the cloud.
